## Scope
This repo contains object oriented spline-fitting code written in c++. Given some time series data, and command line arguments for:

- Number of knot points
- Class of basis functions
    - Truncated power basis
    - B-spline basis
    - ?
- ?

Following e.g. the sklean style of stats classes, we have a model with .fit and .predict methods. 

Return the corresponding fit. Plotting code is also provided.
